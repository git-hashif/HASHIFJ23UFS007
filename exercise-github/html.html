      <h1>HTML Geolocation</h1>
      <p>
        This API is used to find out the location of a user. Considering that
        this can compromise privacy, the specific location will only be
        available if the user approves it. The geolocation is useful, as it
        provides handy information regarding a specific location, or practical
        route information. Many applications today are geolocation based.
      </p>
      <h3 style="color: blue;">Test the location</h3>
      <button onclick="getLocation()">Click for Geolocation</button>

      <h1 >HTML Drag and Drop</h1>
      <p>
        This API enables you to “catch” an element and drag it to a different
        location. HTML Drag and Drop makes it possible for applications to drag
        items and drop them in different browsers. Unlike earlier versions of
        HTML, in HTML5 any element is draggable!

      <h1>HTML Local Storage</h1>
      Thanks to local storage, applications can store large amounts of data
      locally within the user’s browser. This mechanism is similar to session
      cookies, but is more secure and has less impact on website performance.
      Additionally, data in Local Storage has no expiration time and persists
      even after the browser is closed, unlike individual browsing sessions.

      <h1>Newly added HTML Tags</h1>
      <ul>
        <li><b>&lt;article&gt;</b>: The &lt;article&gt; tag is used to represent an
            article. More specifically, the content within the &lt;article&gt; tag
            is independent from the other content of the site (even though it can
            be related).
          </li>
          <li><b>&lt;aside&gt;</b>: The &lt;aside&gt; tag is used to describe the main
            object of the web page in a shorter way like a highlighter. It
            basically identifies the content that is related to the primary
            content of the web page but does not constitute the main intent of the
            primary page. The &lt;aside&gt; tag contains mainly author
            information, links, related content and so on.
          </li>
          <li><b>&lt;figcaption&gt;</b>: The &lt;figcaption&gt; tag in HTML is used to set
            a caption to the figure element in a document.

            self-contained content like illustrations, diagrams, photos or codes
            listing in a document. It is related to main flow, but it can be used
            in any position of a document and the figure goes with the flow of the
            document and if it is removed it should not affect the flow of the
            document.
          </li>
          <li><b>&lt;header&gt;</b>: It contains the section heading as well as other
            content, such as a navigation links, table of contents, etc.
          </li>
          <li><b>&lt;footer&gt;</b>: The &lt;footer&gt; tag in HTML is used to define a
            footer of HTML document. This section contains the footer information
            (author information, copyright information, carriers etc.). The footer
            tag is used within body tag. The &lt;footer&gt; tag is new in the HTML
            5. The footer elements require a start tag as well as an end tag.
          </li>
          <li><b>&lt;main&gt;</b>: Delineates the main content of the body of a document or

            paragraph.
          </li>
          <li><b>&lt;nav&gt;</b>: The &lt;nav&gt; tag is used to declaring the navigational
            section in HTML documents. Websites typically have sections dedicated
            to navigational links, which enables user to navigate the site. These
            links can be placed inside a nav tag.
          </li>
          <li><b>&lt;section&gt;</b>: It demarcates a thematic grouping of content.</li>
          <li><b>&lt;details&gt;</b>: The &lt;details&gt; tag is used for the
            content/information which is initially hidden but could be displayed
            if the user wishes to see it. This tag is used to create interactive
            widget which user can open or close it. The content of details tag is
            visible when open the set attributes.
          </li>
          <li><b>&lt;summary&gt;</b>: The &lt;summary&gt; tag in HTML is used to define a
            summary for the &lt;details&gt; element. The &lt;summary&gt; element
            is used along with the &lt;details&gt; element and provides a summary
            visible to the user. When the summary is clicked by the user, the
            content placed inside the &lt;details&gt; element becomes visible
            which was previously hidden. The &lt;summary&gt; tag was added in HTML
            5. The &lt;summary&gt; tag requires both starting and ending tag.
          </li>
          <li><b>&lt;time&gt;</b>: The &lt;time&gt; tag is used to display the
            human-readable data/time. It can also be used to encode dates and
            times in a machine-readable form. The main advantage for users is that
            they can offer to add birthday reminders or scheduled events in their
            calendars and search engines can produce smarter search results.
          </li>
          <li><b>&lt;bdi&gt;</b>: The &lt;bdi&gt; tag refers to the Bi-Directional
            Isolation. It differentiates a text from other text that may be
            formatted in different direction. This tag is used when a user
            generated text with an unknown direction.
          </li>
          <li><b>&lt;wbr&gt;</b>: The &lt;wbr&gt; tag in HTML stands for word break
            opportunity and is used to define the position within the text which
            is treated as a line break by the browser. It is mostly used when the
            used word is too long and there are chances that the browser may break
            lines at the wrong place for fitting the text.
          </li>
          <li><b>&lt;datalist&gt;</b>: The &lt;datalist&gt; tag is used to provide
            autocomplete feature in the HTML files. It can be used with input tag,
            so that users can easily fill the data in the forms using select the
            data.
          </li>
          <li><b>&lt;keygen&gt;</b>: The &lt;keygen&gt; tag in HTML is used to specify a
            key-pair generator field in a form. The purpose of &lt;keygen&gt;
            element is to provide a secure way to authenticate users. When a form
            is submitted then two keys are generated, private key and public key.
            The private key stored locally, and the public key is sent to the
            server. The public key is used to generate client certificate to

            also defines how much work is done and how much is left to download a
